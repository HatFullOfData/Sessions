# Dynamic Power Query

## Description

Power Query is an powerful tool for transforming a diverse array of data formats, making them ready for analysis in Power BI or Excel. And within Microsoft Fabric, Gen2 dataflows prepare data for storage in selected destinations, all written in M.

However, the M language can be challenging to master. It is particularly unforgiving when dealing with adaptive data schemas and evolving data sources. So, how can we write queries that are flexible and capable of refreshing seamlessly?

This session will provide you with a variety of tips and techniques to effectively manage missing columns, handle changing schemas, and troubleshoot common issues that can disrupt your refresh history. Expect plenty of demonstrations and links to valuable resources to support your learning.
