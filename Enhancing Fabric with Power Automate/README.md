# Enhancing Microsoft Fabric with Power Automate

This session has developed over the past 18 months as Co-pilot has developed and taken over from AI Builder and RPA. Really hoping this session gets retired if / when a Microsoft Fabric connector for Power Automate becomes available.

## New Description

Microsoft Fabric can ingest, transform, store and then let the business analyse the data to make those important data driven decisions. The toolset includes ways to orchestrate and schedule the data journey from raw to a conformed layer and onto a reporting layer. So what does Power Automate bring to the table to enhance this?

Lets start with Co-Pilot and how it can extract data from multiple files and websites to prepare a file of data and triggering this from Power Automate. Then we will investigate how to move that file to OneLake and trigger a Pipeline, all from Power Automate. If time allows there will be other demos

Fun filled demo-rich session from experts in the Microsoft Fabric and Power Platform stack. Every demo will have blogs and YouTube videos supporting them.

## Old Description

Microsoft Fabric can ingest, transform, store and then let the business analyse the data to make those important data driven decisions. The toolset includes ways to orchestrate and schedule the data journey from raw to a conformed layer and onto a reporting layer. So what does Power Automate bring to the table to enhance this?

Lets start with demonstrating how Power Automate Desktop can interact with that old legacy system to fetch the data ready for Microsoft Fabric to ingest. Then onto how to use AI Builder to extract data from documents and into Microsoft Fabric. Next we will move onto showing how Power Automate can enhance orchestration of the data journey from raw to conformed. Finally we will look how Data Activator and Power Automate work together to enhance the reflex to act in custom ways. Interweaving as we go the governance and security issues that we should be aware of.
