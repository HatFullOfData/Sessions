# Microsoft Fabric Introduction

## Description

Microsoft announced Fabric back in May 2023. This new platform brings some well known Azure data tools and some brand new data tools into the workspace environment we know through Power BI. With pipelines, dataflows, lakehouses and much more there is a whole bunch of new things to learn. But why bother? 

In this session I will show how Microsoft Fabric brings low code offerings to help you work with data. Allowing the business to have its own citizen data engineers in the same way Power Platform enabled the citizen devs to build apps and automation.
