# Paginated Reports have had some Love

## Description

Paginated reports are great for those pixel perfect pages we still need and those Excel exports that businesses desire. And the engineers at Microsoft have been giving Paginated reports some love. Early 2024 we got Power Query, over the past year we've seen online creation from datasets improving and now we have the dynamic per recipient subscriptions.

In this session, using business cases we will walk through how paginated reports are still a vital part of the reporting landscape. We will discuss what licenses we need to do the magic. I promise lots of demos and laughter
