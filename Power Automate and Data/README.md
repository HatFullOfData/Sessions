# Power Automate and Data

This session is an adaptation of my Power BI and Power Automate doing what they do best. Its based on the line from Keith Whatling, "It's Power Automate NOT Power Integrate".

## Description

Power Automate is a great low-code automation tool that we all know and love. Sometimes though we push Power Automate to do things it was never meant to do. I often have to remind people it is Power Automate not Power Integrate. Looping through 10,000 records is not a great idea in Power Automate.

In this session we will look at how we can get Power Automate to make data tools do the dirty work and Power Automate do what it does best and orchestrate the work.
Lots of demos and laughter
