# Translytical Flows vs Embedded Power App

You create a brilliant report, it matches all the requirements and then someone asks for write back. They want to add adjustments, commentary or other random ideas. Although we would love to say no, we end up building solutions to provide write back. Previously the obvious options have been an embedded Power App or a Power Automate button. Then Microsoft made up new words and released Translytical Flows that use User Defined Functions to provide new write back functionality.

In this session we will demo building this new feature from scratch along side a demo of a simple Power App doing the same write back. Then we will have the fun of comparing the functionality, useability and maybe even the licencing. Who will win? 

Plenty of demos, audience participation and time for questions.
